I am a software engineer. I am an aviation geek. I was born in USSR. I now live in NJ, USA. I currently work for [Identity And Access Management group at Unicon](https://www.unicon.net/solutions/identity-and-access-management){:target="_blank"}. And of course opinions expressed here are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my current employer.
